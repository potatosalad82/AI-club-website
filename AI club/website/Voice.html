      <h5>Annoucing module JAVA_1, July 17, 2018</h5>
     
      <p>
		  This will be our first ever lesson on the site and it will be free imediatly after released. Normally when we release a module those with a preium account
		  get access to the module for a week or two before we release it for free. While we would prefer not to have to do this Corperate requires money and if we 
		  don't give the souless monster money it will take our souls as compensation and I kinda like my soul just a little. To prevent this you can donate to us or
		  buy a really cheap membership so we can continue producing more lessons. Anyway back to the annoucement, on our lessons tab you will see the JAVA 1 modulae 
		  and you can click on it to start the lessons.
      </p>
			It will appear in August and it will contain lessons with videos activities and quizes. We will also have 1 hour a day that you can chat with us live for 
			help. If you would be interested in an in person class please go to our contact page for more info. The lessons will start from the basics and eventually 
			ease you in to complex stuff that is past college level but that won't be for awhile. Also we plan to put these lessons up in one big group so you can 
			skip through to the parts you need or just answer you problems for school ha ha. Anyway we will have a more detailed discription later but for now Donate 
			please. EndGame out.
      <p>

		  Welcome to the grand opening of Potato Schools. This is a project from Potato Industries with the goal to teach others coding from scratch to computer learning
		  algorithms. We will release one group of lessons every month or so eventually creating a curiculm that spans multiple diffrent coding languages as well as
		  3D modelling, photoshop, and more. If you enjoy our lessons please donate so that we can keep everything free. If we do not recive many donations we will try
		  to still keep everything free but maybe release stuff early to those who donate. Anyway we are also going to open hours where you can live chat with a coach for
		  help and maybe even open up in person classes someday.
